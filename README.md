This is a take­home coding exercise targeted for TVC candidates to work on Android app teams.
Coding exercise
The goal of this exercise is to build a simple Android app to search for GitHub repositories.
A typical use case is:
1. User opens the app.
2. Types the search query. E.g. “Game of Life” or “JSON parser”.
3. Taps the “Search” button to search for GitHub repositories.
4. Search results displayed below sorted by the stars number in descending order.
User Interface
Keep the UI simple and functional. Fancy and super polished UI is not the goal here as the time
is limited. A simple query input, a “Search” button and a vertical scrollable list with search results
will be enough.
Let each row of the list to display an owner avatar, a repository name, description and the
number of stars. For simplicity, you can just use a Unicode symbol ★ instead of the star icon.
Data
Please use the GitHub API to search for repositories. The API is free, public and doesn’t require
an account or authorization, so the API is easy to test just from the browser.
What we will be looking for
The main things we looking for in this exercise are:
● The app is functional ­ It does the job of searching GitHub repositories as required.
● The app is stable ­ It doesn’t crash or leak resources.
● The code is clean, easy to read and work with.
There are many extra features you may need to have in the real production app like tablet UI,
pagination support, etc. But due to the time constraints it’s not required. Just focus on the base
use case functionality.
Requirements
● please spend no more than 2 hours on this exercise.
● android:minSdkVersion ­ your choice.
● android:targetSdkVersion ­ API 27 (Android 8.1)
● Feel free to use 3rd party libraries if needed.
